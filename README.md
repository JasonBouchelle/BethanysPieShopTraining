# BethanysPieShopTraining


This is the code for C# Fundamentals training course from pluralsight. I am moving it from my mac to this repository so that I can clone the repository to my windows machine and work in VS2022 there. Some featuers being used in the lessons are not supported in VS2002 Mac version.
